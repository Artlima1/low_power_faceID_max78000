	abstract = {Small factor and ultra-low power devices are becoming more and more smart and capable even for deep learning network inference. And as the devices are ”small”, the challenge is becoming tougher. This paper covers full development and deployment pipeline of Face Recognition with a live camera — from model training and quantization to porting to {RISC}-V {MCU} with 512 kilobytes of internal {RAM}. Authors provide {GreenWaves} {GAP}8 {SoC} overview and the approaches for {DNN} model optimization and inference in the extreme environment. As the project outcome, authors were able to run Face Detection and Recognition with live {QVGA} camera and display preview on a batterypowered board. We will release the module for {GAP}8compatible quantization1.},

	abstract = {In the embedded system environment, both large amount of face image data and the slow recognition process speed are the main problem facing face recognition of end devices. This paper proposes a face recognition algorithm based on dual-channel images and adopts a cropped {VGG}-like model referred as {VGG}-cut model for predicting. The training set uses the same single-layer images of the same person combined into dual channels as a positive example, and single-layer images of different people are combined into dual channels as a negative example. After model training, the trained face verification model is used as the basis of face recognition, and the final recognition result can be obtained through loop matching and similarity ranking. The experimental results on a {RISC}-V embedded {FPGA} platform show that compared with the {ResNet} model called in Dlib, the {VGG}-like model and {MobileFaceNet} trained by Keras, our algorithm is increased by 240×, 88×, and 19× in recognition speed, respectively without significant accuracy reduction.},

	abstract = {In digital image processing, the sum of absolute differences ({SAD}) is a measure of the similarity between image blocks.  It is calculated by taking the absolute difference between each pixel in the original block and the corresponding pixel in the block being used for comparison.  These differences are summed to create a simple metric of block similarity, the L1 norm of the difference image or Manhattan distance between two image blocks.
The sum of absolute differences may be used for a variety of purposes, such as object recognition, the generation of disparity maps for stereo images, and motion estimation for video compression.},

	abstract = {An ultra-low-power analog-digital hybrid alwayson face recognition ({FR}) processor integrated with a {CMOS} image sensor ({CIS}) is proposed for the wearable mobile devices applications such as user authentication. The proposed processor is the first {IC} with full process of {FR} in a single chip. The processor adopts analog-digital hybrid convolution operation for efficient integration of {CNN} processor with {CIS}. The analog convolution processor is proposed for the computation of the 1st layer of {CNN} and the quantization operation without an {ADC} that can achieve 15.7\% power reduction with 1.3\% minimal accuracy loss. In addition, the analog weighted-sum unit with low power ({\textless} 20{μW}) and high efficiency ({\textgreater} 5.18TOPS/W) is proposed with switched-drain regulation ({SDR}) current mirror which can achieve less than 6\% mirroring error. The processor is simulated in 65-nm {CMOS} technology, 15.84mm2 area with 2.5V and 1.2V for analog domain and 0.77-1.1V for digital domain. It consumes 0.6198mW to evaluate one face at 1 fps and achieves 96.18\% {FR} accuracy in {LFW} dataset.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an always-on Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor ({CMOS}) image sensor ({CIS}) using an analog convolutional neural network for image classiﬁcation in mobile applications. To reduce the power consumption as well as the overall processing time, we propose analog convolution circuits for computing convolution, max-pooling, and correlated double sampling operations without operational transconductance ampliﬁers. In addition, we used the voltage-mode {MAX} circuit for max pooling in the analog domain. After the analog convolution processing, the image data were reduced by 99.58\% and were converted to digital with a 4-bit single-slope analog-to-digital converter. After the conversion, images were classiﬁed by the fully connected processor, which is traditionally performed in the digital domain. The measurement results show that we achieved an 89.33\% image classiﬁcation accuracy. The prototype {CIS} was fabricated in a 0.11 µm 1-poly 4-metal {CIS} process with a standard 4T-active pixel sensor. The image resolution was 160 × 120, and the total power consumption of the proposed {CIS} was 1.12 {mW} with a 3.3 V supply voltage and a maximum frame rate of 120.},

The computational complexity of the underlying algorithms as well as the power consumption of the entire imaging and processing system largely limit the deployment to powerful mobile processing systems with large rechargeable batteries. However, these computer vision capabilities would also be useful in miniaturized low power applications with stringent battery-size limitations. We assess the feasibility of such a computer vision edge processing system on a battery-less credit card-sized demonstrator using an ultra-low power image sensor and a machine learning system-onchip, achieving self-sustainable operation using solar energy harvesting with a small on-board solar cell. The tested system enables continuous 1 frame-per-second battery-less imaging and face recognition in indoor lighting conditions.},
